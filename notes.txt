//a graph traversal problem the size of the graph is [0, 7]
//can be represent as either an adjacency list, adjacency matrix[utilizing binary], 
// list of the vertext that have an edge on the vertices taken from khan academy

//the goal is to find the shortest amount of moves to reach between two nodes
//vertices of the graph is equal to [0, 0] up to [7, 7]
//the edges are how the knight moves.

//takes paramaters for starting position and ending position. determine the amount of moves and the callback print of each vertex
//visited afterwards.
